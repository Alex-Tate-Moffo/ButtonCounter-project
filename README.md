 ***Note:*** Any issues you have with either the GitHub steps or Java/Android questions should be asked publically in Piazza. If you have a question, chances are someone else does also. If you see someone has posted a question on Piazza and you know the answer, please chime in and answer. This might seem rough at the beginning, but I promise it will get easier.
